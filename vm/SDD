0. Background and Terminology

	A. Backtracking

	Given a set of rules and a goal, we define additional goals to be the
	premises of the rules that has consequences that match (unify with)
	the current goal, all under the possible substitutions. These goals are
	then queued until ground is reached.

	B. Unification

	C. KB Expansion

	Taking advantage of some speed vs size tradeoff, we define a process
	of kb expansion that lists the possible matches per premise. This is
	done by *trimming* terms. Every pair of body and head, in case they
	can match without substitutions, is represented by a modified pair of
	terms, namely, trimmed terms.

	D. Trimming

	The trimming process takes two terms and returns two terms. The output
	terms are equal to the original terms, except that matching equal
	subterms are omitted. For example, trimming "?x a y" and "?z a y" will
	return the two terms "?x" and "?y".

	E. Backtracking Over Expanded KB

	To check a match between a body and a head, a unification of the
	trimmed terms has to take place. Then the resulted substitutions from
	this unification has to propagate to the target rule's body.
	Since there are no specific bodies anymore, but trimmed terms
	relatively to the trimmed heads they can match to, we have to propagate
	the substitutions to the trimmed bodies and then re-trim wrt their
	matching trimmed head.

1. Flat vs Deep Term Representation

	A. Deep

	Typically a term is equivalently represented as:
		struct term {
			atom a;
			vector<term*> args;
		};
	or in a more detailed grammar:
		Atom := int
		List := ([Atom|List]*)
		Term := Atom | List
		Trip := Term Term Term
		Rule := Trip Trip*
		Sub  := Atom == Term
		Env  := Sub*
		Kb   := Rule* // traditional, untrimmed
	which is a deep (tree) structure. Such implies unification method that
	assigns variables one tree node that represent a subterm.

	The downside with the typical deep representation is that it requires
	indirection.

	B. Flat

	Terms can also be represented in a flat way similar to how it is
	written in its original syntax, namely equivalent to:
		struct term {
			vector<atom> a;
		};
	where some atoms represent open and close brackets and by that simulate
	deep structure.
	On this case unification of a variable with a list assigns the variable
	a location of an opening bracket and a closing bracket, suggesting to 
	modify the above grammar with:
		Atom := int | ( | )
		Term := Atom* // with matching brackets
		Trip := Term Term Term
		Rule := Trip Trip*
		Sub  := Atom == Atom | Term,int,int
		Env  := Sub*
		Kb   := Rule* // traditional, untrimmed

2. IR
	The expanded kb could be described as:
		Atom := int | ( | )
		Term := Atom* // with matching brackets
		Trip := Term Term Term
		Prem := [int Trip Trip]* // trimmed terms and head number
		Rule := Prem*
		Sub  := Atom == Term
		Env  := Sub*
		Kb   := Rule*

3. Persistent Terms

	A. Why We Need Persistent Terms

	Persistency arise while trying to optimize the process of trimming
	and re-trimming terms.

	B. Persistency of Deep Terms
	C. Persistency of Flat Terms

4. Equivalence Classes
	Subtitutions form equivalence classes. Solving them might require
	additional equivalence classes (e.g. for lists). This has to be
	optimally reflected in the data structures and the flow, e.g. by using
	modified Tarjan's union-find or modified C&F persistent union-find.

5. Subtree Reuse
