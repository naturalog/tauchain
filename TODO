1)fix up the nq parser

2)debug the cli

marpa unicode:
hardcode regexes. or implement escape sequences in string literals?
introduce ICU
implement escape sequences in string literals?

rdf lists:
data structures should be almost done, just redo the first/rest/in/last builtins

rdf semantics:
fix the wildcard fucker, the rest should be straightforward

random builtins?





Nov. 19th:
*What specification of n3 are we supporting
n3-grammar.n3
15:49 < koo7> im not planning to support full n3
15:50 < koo7> it also doesnt support bnodes, its still unclear to me how they 
              would be represented in tau
15:50 < koo7> and our support of unicode sucks on all levels
15:51 < koo7> i also noticed some bug with multiline formulas


*Tau command-line input stack switch
working on it..
*Simplify tau command-line processing code
possibly employ a state machine? could we export one from mbeddr?


*What's up with bnodes
no idea, ask hmc


*Fix Unicode support (find out what's wrong with it)
the reasoner is or should be agnostic to string encoding, 
where this matters is:
 when doing regexes in the n3 parser
 possibly in some builtins
http://cppwhispers.blogspot.cz/2012/11/unicode-and-your-application-3-of-n.html
http://unicode.org/resources/libraries.html
http://utf8everywhere.org/
we should drop the "w" strings because they arent well supported, or rather,
it should be possible to compile with as well as without w
it seems theres only one way to do unicode properly and that is the ICU library
it is quite heavyweight, so it should be an optional dependency


*Find out what the multi-line formulas bug is
*What's up with our quoted strings
nq parser?
*Change nq_to_qdb() to just generate a qdb instead of going round-about at it.
*What's wrong with our list reasoning
*Strip out old::prover stuff
*Organize univar.cpp
*Do we really need all those permutations?
yes, and there will be more
*Formal verification
*Implement RDFS
*Implement built-ins
*Implement consistency check
